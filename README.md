This project demonstrates a complete, automated CI (Continuous Integration) pipeline for a simple Flask web application using **Azure Pipelines**. The pipeline automatically runs unit tests, builds a Docker image, and pushes it to Docker Hub, all triggered by a push to the main branch.

The entire process runs on a **self-hosted agent**, showcasing how to integrate your own infrastructure with Azure DevOps.
